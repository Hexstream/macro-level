MACRO-LEVEL is an embarassingly trivial convenience macro that saves
on indentation while being more concise and direct.


(macro-level
  ...)
==
;; Canonical indentation. MACRO-LEVEL saves 11 spaces.
(macrolet ((m ()
             ...))
  (m))
==
;; "Miser" indentation. MACRO-LEVEL saves 5 spaces.
(macrolet
    ((m ()
       ...))
  (m))
