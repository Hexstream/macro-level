MACRO-LEVEL is an embarassingly trivial convenience macro that saves
on indentation while being more concise and direct.


(macro-level
  ...)
==
;; Canonical indentation. MACRO-LEVEL saves 11 spaces.
(macrolet ((m ()
             ...))
  (m))
==
;; "Miser" indentation. MACRO-LEVEL saves 5 spaces.
(macrolet
    ((m ()
       ...))
  (m))


When used as part of a macroexpansion, MACRO-LEVEL also conveniently
relieves the macro implementor from naming and using a gensym for the
one-shot macro when compared to writing out a MACROLET by hand, in
addition to the other advantages.


To use MACRO-LEVEL, simply (macro-level:macro-level ...) after loading
the ASDF system, as this macro is not used that often and the length
won't have any effect on the indentation:

(macro-level:macro-level
  ...)
VS
(macro-level
  ...)

Simply (:import-from #:macro-level #:macro-level) in your DEFPACKAGE
if you prefer the latter form. Don't (:use)!


Support could eventually be added to Slime so that interactive
macroexpansion of MACRO-LEVEL calls with C-c C-m (slime-expand-1)
would show the same expansion as interactively macroexpanding (m ...)
after (defmacro m () ...), assuming the lexical context is not
important.
